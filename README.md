# Launched_Projects
1) Project title: Exploratory data analysis
I've performed eda on a file named cuisine rating using vs code. The dataset cuisine rating was taken from kaggle. 
To perform eda I've used the following libraries in python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
The same code can be used to run eda on different files by just changing the file name and the column names as per requirement.
2) Project title: Linear regression
Performing linear regression on a dataset .
Getting the scatter plot which helps us understand the variation of the dependent variable on the independent variable.
To perform linear regression the libraries used are almost similar to the ones used to perform eda. That is pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

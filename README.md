Project title: Exploratory data analysis
I've performed eda on a file named cuisine rating using vs code. The dataset cuisine rating was taken from kaggle. 
To perform eda I've used the following libraries in python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
The same code can be used to run eda on different files by just changing the file name and the column names as per requirement.
